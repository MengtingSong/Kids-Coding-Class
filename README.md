# Kids-Coding-Class

## Project Description
This project is a coding class designed for children aged around 7 to learn programming through MIT Scratch. It’s also programmed using Scratch. The whole class is about an adventure story of a young brave hero traveling through the space to find powerful weapons to defeat the evil witch and dragon who destroyed his homeland. The children will learn programming skills and techniques step by step by following the class progress and “conquering challenges in the adventure journey one by one”.

In this repository, you can find the Scratch codes (*sb2/sb3) and video demos of the class kickoff and end shows, the practices and solutions of the first two lessons. It also contains the teaching presentation and notes of the first lesson in Chinese. To run the *.sb2/sb3 files, an offline version of Scratch needs be downloaded ( [https://scratch.mit.edu/download](https://scratch.mit.edu/download) ).
